This app is made for my daughter to learn keyboard letters while typing
Concept:
1. Full screen web app runnning in KIOSK mode
2. Upon pressing a key on the keyboard this key is displayed in a big, bolded way on a screen of a random color (keep contrast to background)
3. letter on screen fades away slowly
4. upon pressing another key - key appears on screen instead of previous one and starts fadeout animation.
